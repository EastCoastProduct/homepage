<p>When looking for an all-in-one solution for our clients, we turn to <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>. It’s a complete front-end framework that is incredibly reliable. Angular is great for clients that are looking for consistency without relying too heavily on third-party modules for necessary functionality. Its opinionated stance on how to do many common tasks means our team (and yours) doesn’t have to re-invent the wheel on every project, giving them the flexibility to prioritize work that will have the most meaningful impact on your users.</p>

<h2>Why we use Angular</h2>

<h3>Templating</h3>

<p>Angular lets us be more efficient when it comes to building UI code that integrates seamlessly with a back-end. This makes it great for when you need to get from nothing to something fast.</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>Angular was built to support testing smoothly, right out of the box. Its end-to-end testing tools make efficiently producing quality code a breeze.</p>

<h3>The best tool for enterprise jobs</h3>

<p>Since Angular is all about consistency, speed, and tooling it is the perfect solution for large enterprise projects. Using too many third party add-ons creates a risk of breaking your application with a simple update. Angular helps us mitigate the risk of broken features because there’s less reliance on third party add-ons.</p>
