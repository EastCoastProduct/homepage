When you are looking for a one stop shop consistent framework, we turn to <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular</a>. With the recent launch of Angular 2.0, Angular is a complete frontend framework that is incredibly reliable. Angular is great for enterprise clients that are looking for consistency without relying too heavily on third-party modules. Too many third-party modules, and you’re gonna have a bad time.

## Why we use Angular

### Templating

Angular lets us be efficient when it comes to reusing feature blocks. Templating is great when you need to get from nothing to something fast.

### Testing

Angular was built with testing in mind. Out-of-the-box, Angular comes with end-to-end testing tools that make testing a breeze.

### The best tool for enterprise jobs

Since Angular’s m.o. is all about consistency, it is the perfect solution for large enterprise projects. If there are too many third party add-ons on a given platform, there will be a large risk of breaking all the things with a simple update. Using Angular’s full framework, we can mitigate the risk of broken features because there’s less reliance on third party add-ons.
