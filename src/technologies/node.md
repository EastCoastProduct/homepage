It’s no secret how we feel about JavaScript (we write love notes to JavaScript all the time). We believe that by building with JavaScript, you’re building future-forward, modern applications. The best way to build with JavaScript is with <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a>. With JavaScript already the language of choice on the frontend, we like to use Node on the backend. With it’s event driven, I/O model, Node allows us to build scalable network applications for clients with a few employees or thousands.

## Why we use Node

### Node Package Manager

NPM is the most popular packaging manager out there. It’s an open-source shared-repository of good-to-go Node tools and modules. What does that mean? It will install the packages you want to use and provide an easy interface to work with them. By utilizing NPM, we can go from nothing to something in record time.

### JavaScript on both the front-end and back-end

With our expertise in React and Angular, Node makes it easy for us us to build full stack JavaScript applications.
