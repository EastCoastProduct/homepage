We believe <a href="https://www.javascript.com/">JavaScript</a> is the best tool for getting our clients to solutions as quickly as possible. It allows us to build the best future-forward applications that scale with the modern web. Why? Well, tons of large tech companies support and use JavaScript, like Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Accenture, and many others. It’s fast, agile, and has a robust ecosystem and network of support. By focusing on mastering JavaScript, we’re also able to move efficiently into related technologies like React and Node.

## Why we use JavaScript

### React Native

React Native is the best solution for building native mobile experiences with the JavaScript we know and love.

### Node

Node is lightweight, efficient and scalable. It let us use JavaScript on the server, not just the client side.

### Angular

Angular is an industry-proven and tested front-end framework, built and maintained by Google.
