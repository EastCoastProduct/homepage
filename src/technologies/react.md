There seems to be new Javascript libraries popping up weekly if not daily. It’s crazy out there. We definitely have eyes for only one library at the moment: <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>. React allows us to build highly performant, client-side web applications quickly and efficiently - like way, way faster . By working with a component-based frontend with an easy-to-read syntax, React makes collaboration both internally with our development team and externally with your team as smooth as silk. React is integral to our design philosophy because it can efficiently translate component-based UX/UI design and lets us reuse components. When it comes to frontend libraries, our first choice is React and we wouldn’t have it any other way.

## Projects we've used it on

* TSN
* Human Condition Safety
* Resilient Coders

## Why we use React

### Flexibility

React can be implemented gradually, swapped in or out as you see fit, and it’s compatible with a variety of technology stacks.

### Components &amp; the future of web development

Component-based development is the future. By using React, we can stay agile while designing and developing for the web. React forces our designers to consider the state and nature of React components, streamlining the translation from initial design to User Experience and User Interface.

### Development tools

An out-of-the-box development tool, with the official React Chrome extension, makes debugging your application much simpler. These tools allow you to take a look at a virtual dom as if it were a full DOM tree right in the elements panel.

### Facebook engineers maintain React

Did we mention that the Facebook engineering team created and maintains the React library that’s now an open-source project? All of Instagram was built on React. We want to the languages, libraries, and frameworks that have the best support from technology companies. React definitely meets that requirement.
