description:Vsnap is a video messaging platform for inside sales. The appâ€™s mission is to humanize sales interactions to build sustained business relationships. As Vsnap grew and the user-base became more defined, it became clearer to CEO, Dave McLaughlin, that the prototype application in its current state was not scalable. In December 2013, he brought in Chris Swenor as CTO and the East Coast Product development team to rethink the app.
