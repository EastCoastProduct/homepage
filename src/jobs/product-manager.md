<p>Grow your career as a Product Manager in the Boston office of our growing software development agency.</p>

<p>We are looking to bring a motivated and talented individual who shares our passion for learning and development. At East Coast Product, building a diverse team with a collaborative work culture has always been a top priority. Since our founding, we have fostered a challenging and motivating work environment. With our sights set on employee satisfaction, we provide our team members with everything they will need grow their skills and expand their career.</p>

<p>The ideal candidate has 3-5 years of experience helping shepherd new products from idea to market. They will have experience with a few different flavors of Agile, and some opinions on what does and does not work about the various methodologies. They should have prior experience optimizing a team’s process to improve it over time and more effectively and predictably deliver shipped product.</p>

<p>Early work for this position will primarily be leading a current project team on a complicated client project as we improve our process and our ability to deliver consistently good work. Over time this work will evolve to include research and discovery on early products and features, exploring ways to add value to our clients’ businesses, and teaching other team members foundational skills in product management. Our short-term needs are primarily tactical (getting things done) but we’re looking for someone who can evolve into a strategic asset and is interested in leadership in the company.</p>

<p>We value curiosity, intelligence, and an incessant need to improve. People that ask a lot of questions, are willing to admit what they don’t know, and instinctively cringe at the phrase “that’s how we’ve always done it” are a perfect fit for the our company and this position in particular.</p>
