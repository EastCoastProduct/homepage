<p>East Coast Product is a design and development agency that specializes in staff augmentation for the entrepreneur, enterprise, and everyone in between. With on-demand experts, we provide boosts to existing product teams to help them hit their next milestone.</p>

<p>We are looking for a Senior Product Designer to work closely with clients, design complex applications, and help shape the company as we continue to grow.</p>

<h2 class="text-heading-two">About You</h2>

<p>You have an extensive background in visual design or UX and lots of experience designing and building for the modern web. Not only do you have the experience but you are fascinated with the practices and processes of human-centered design.</p>

<p>You are curious, intelligent, and have an incessant need to improve. Designers that ask a lot of questions, are willing to admit what they don’t know, and instinctively cringe at the phrase “that’s how we’ve always done it” are a perfect fit for us.</p>

<p>You are excited by the prospect of working on projects of all types from small MVPs for budding entrepreneurs to complex applications for much larger clients. As an early hire you’ll play a meaningful role in crafting how our company learns to practice design as a discipline across these wildly different types of projects.</p>

<p>You’re committed to diversity & inclusion and have a proven history of promoting a learning culture. You have an entrepreneurial mind-set and aren’t afraid to try new ways of doing things.</p>

<p>You have experience working with a mostly remote team and can contribute actively as we build our best practices around hiring and managing remotely.</p>

<h2 class="text-heading-two">About the Job</h2>

<p>As a product designer at ECP, you’ll be working with clients/teams of 5-50 people. You’ll play a meaningful role in crafting how our company practices design as a discipline across these wildly different types of projects, and how we teach our clients to make design a first-class discipline within their companies.</p>
