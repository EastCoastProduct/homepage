<p>Clutch is a platform that identifies leading B2B software and professional services firms that are continually delivering great results to their clients. They serve as a helping hand in the B2B research process and have helped countless companies find the partners that fit their needs. As part of this research, they sat down with some current and previous clients to perform an assessment of our capabilities and the quality of our work we produce. We earned a perfect score. 5 out of 5.</p>

<p>But don’t just take it from us, here are some of the quotes from our clients on Clutch:</p>

<p><em>"What I most appreciated about working with East Coast Product was the combination of project management, transparency, accountability, and quality of code."</em></p>

<p><em>"I always knew what was going on. They communicated with me clearly, in real-time…it seemed that there was always someone working on my project."</em></p>

<p><em>"East Coast Product performed up to our expectations, and accomplished everything we set out to within our pre-established 4-week timeframe."</em></p>

<p>We’re excited for the cool work we’ve done so far and we’re committed to continuing to build and grow to do our best for our clients.  Hope to see you again on the list in 2018.</p>
