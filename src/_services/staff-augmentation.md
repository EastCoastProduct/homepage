<h2 class="text-heading-two">What’s different about staff augmentation?</h2>

<p>Staff augmentation is for teams that already have a strong management structure and process in place and just need a little extra horsepower. If you have short-term or uncertain staffing needs then staff augmentation can be a much more affordable option than hiring new employees, but with instant access to the same expertise you’d expect a permanent hire to develop over time.</p>

<p>Here are the key differences between staff augmentation and a fully managed project:</p>
