<h2>The discovery process</h2>

<div class="services--container-image right">
  <img src="../../images/services-illustrations/discovery.svg" alt="Illustration of a cluttered whiteboard." />
</div>

<p>A successful project starts with understanding. Together, we take a deep look at the business and your users to fully understand what needs to be built and why.</p>

<p>Our designers practice a variety of user experience and strategy activities that have been formulated to quickly identify the real problem and the right approach to solving it. Utilizing tools like the Design Sprint, <a href="http://www.gv.com/sprint/">created by the team at Google Ventures</a>, we can get to high-confidence answers to tricky problems as fast as possible. By communicating directly with the potential users of your product we can work out a plan to help your business succeed by meeting their unexpressed needs.</p>

<h2>User experience and user interface design</h2>

</div>

<p>Not only does your app need to be use easy to use, it needs to be built with the right users in mind and solve the problems that are most meaningful to them. With our proven process, we know exactly how to tackle these challenges efficiently. Over the course of a project, we’ll continually refine our user research, and test prototypes of new functionality to better understand its impact before building. By approaching user experience iteratively we can lower expenses and the risk associated with building the wrong product.</p>

<h2>Full-stack JavaScript web development</h2>

<div class="services--container-image right">
  <img src="../../images/services-illustrations/development.svg" alt="Illustration of a developer's laptop." />
</div>

<p>Our developers build flexible, fast and scalable web applications using Node.js, Express and React. Why did we choose to go with JavaScript for our entire tech stack? Simply put, hiring developers with deep JS proficiency creates a quicker path to full-stack expertise based on fluency in one language instead of many.</p>

<h3>Node.js</h3>

<p><a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> allows our devs to take their mastery of client-side JavaScript to the server-side, creating efficient experts in full-stack web development. Its emphasis on scalability and speed (among <a href="http://blog.modulus.io/top-10-reasons-to-use-node">many other advantages</a>) allow us to build the best experience for your users.</p>

<h3>React</h3>

<p>We use <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> to help maintain consistency in our user interfaces. It helps our designers and developers think about systems built on stateful components instead of pages, and we think the techniques it encourages are <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/why-react.html">the future of building web UIs</a>.</p>

<h3>React Native</h3>

<p><a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a> lets our devs bring their expertise in JavaScript to iOS and Android. This means your native app can share code with your web app and receive updates live instead of waiting for app store approval. And you’ll benefit from everything the incredibly active JavaScript community has to offer.</p>
