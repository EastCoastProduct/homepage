description: <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/" target="_blank">React Native</a> lets our devs bring their expertise in JavaScript to iOS and Android. This means your native app can share code with your web app and receive updates live instead of waiting for app store approval. And you'll benefit from the enormous community surrounding JavaScript.
