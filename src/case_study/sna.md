## Intro

Since 2001, Safety NetAccess(SNA) has been designing, building and supporting wireless networks for hotels, resorts and other public properties. Their flagship product, SNAP, is a hotel internet management software responsible for connecting millions of users and thousands of hotels every year.

## Challenge

After 14 years and three completely different iterations of SNAP, CEO Sean Gorman, realized that over the years, SNAP became increasingly difficult to manage. Clients were using different versions of the software, and this legacy product had outgrown itself. Even then, competitors have been unable to catch up to SNA, and they decided to take advantage of this by rebuilding their product into a SaaS platform that could be sold to competitors.

## Solution

By utilizing the API-first development methodology, we rebuilt SNAPx from the ground up in 28 weeks. The platform is much more scalable and additional features and services can be bolted on. This new product will allow SNA to grow their business in a new way. Not only can they provide a world-class WiFi experience to customers like Hilton and Marriott, SNA can begin generating revenue from companies seeking to license the technology for their existing products. The platform rebuild of SNAPx positions SNA to grow for the long-term, and we’re excited to be part of their future growth.
