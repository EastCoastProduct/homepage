## Intro

Vsnap is a video messaging platform for inside sales. The app’s mission is to humanize sales interactions to build sustained business relationships. To use the app, sales representatives record up to a 60-second video message that can include attachments or a note to the recipient. Sales reps just need to know the email address of the recipient to make sure the video message is received.

## Problem

As Vsnap grew and the user-base became more defined, it became clearer to CEO, Dave McLaughlin, that the prototype application in its current state was not scalable. The original Vsnap application was intended to be a prototype only. Because of this, the technology became outdated and the application monolithic very quickly. Any code updates required careful planning because it was unclear how changes would reverberate in other parts of the application. Updates took several hours of developer time and significant downtime that inconvenienced customers. Leaving things as-is with the Vsnap prototype was not sustainable for the long-term.

## Solution

After careful research and deliberation, the development team unilaterally decided that the best approach was to rewrite the entire application. The Vsnap product in its current didn’t have any code that was worth recycling and was written in a language that was losing popularity - Grails. Using an API-first, modularized approach to development, the team decided the application would be rebuilt in JavaScript because of the abundance of resources and ability to scale for the future. The application was relaunched and resulted in the successful acquisition of Vsnap in April 2015
