## Intro

Innovation Women is a speaker’s bureau for qualified women to promote their expertise and stories and for event planners to find and book those women for events. Innovation Women rose out of the glaring problem of male-dominated panels at technical and entrepreneurial events.

## Problem

The founder of Innovation Women, Bobbie Carlton, wanted to get an application up and running for women seeking out speaking opportunities, but she didn’t have the technical expertise to make the application a reality. Additionally, she had a three week deadline to design and build an MVP for Innovation Women. Despite a successful Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for development, a couple of false starts and the lack of a technical cofounder were barriers to translating the vision into a tangible product.

## Solution

East Coast Product and Innovation Women worked closely with Bobbie to understand her business plan and vision because getting this application to MVP meant having a very open dialogue about the project. Working fast and being agile through design sprints and the development process was critical to the successful completion of the application. Open communication was critical to the success of the project. Additionally, the fast turn-around meant more time to test the overall concept and product-market-fit.
