<h2 class="text-heading-two">Challenge</h2>

<p>The leaders of various nonprofit and community groups had trouble communicating events to their target demographic and potential volunteers. There was no centralized channel for discovery of new events and reaching new audiences. Each organization relied on individual marketing efforts, making it difficult for volunteers and the broader public to find relevant events and resources.  With all the emails lists and independent forums trying to achieve the same goal, it became clear that there had a to be a central hub to tackle this problem.</p>

<h2 class="text-heading-two">Solution</h2>

<p>To determine the most efficient way to tackle these challenges, East Coast Product ran a design sprint with the leaders of the Timothy Smith Network and City Awake. The goal of the sprint was to discover what features both event organizers and target attendees would require discover new events and services. The East Coast Product team focused on creating a calendar platform that would not only display event information in an attractive way, but would be easy and intuitive to use by the community. Through the design sprint, we learned that users were more likely to use search engines over going directly to aggregate event sites. To address this, we used Isomorphic React.js to improve the siteâ€™s SEO (Search Engine Optimization).</p>

<p>Together, we built out an application that not only increased the visibility of some incredible organizations doing important work in Boston, but we increased community access to these important events and resources.</p>
