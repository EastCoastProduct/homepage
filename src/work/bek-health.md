<p class="paragraph--major">Bek Health is an organization that wants to connect cancer patients to trials that have the best chance of being improving their outcome as a patient. By optimizing the trial matching process cancer patients will get an opportunity to participate in the best trials for their condition, while cancer centers get better study results. To take this life-changing idea and make it a reality the team at Bek Health approached East Coast Product to help validate their concept and design a prototype to demo with potential investors.</p>

<h1 class="text-heading-one">User Validation to Help with Funding</h1>

<p>Success in this project meant spending enough time to validate the idea, and building out a clickable prototype to help get investors excited. We focused on interviewing and testing with potential clinical users to decide which features were necessary. After completing our first prototype the Bek Health team was able to take it to investor meetings with confidence, knowing their designs are user validated.</p>

<h1 class="text-heading-one">MVP Prototyping</h1>

<p>With Bek Health being pre-funding we needed to ensure that we optimized their ROI on this project by delivering a finished prototype while ruthlessly prioritizing to stay within the allotted time and budget. By focusing on building a prototype first, we were able to use limited funds to maximum effect. Using InVision for our prototype gave potential investors a really good look at what we could potentially build without going to the expense of developing it.</p>
