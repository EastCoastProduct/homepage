<h2>The discovery process</h2>

</div>

<p>A successful project starts with understanding. Together, we take a deep look at the business and your users to fully understand what needs to be built and why.</p>

<p>Our designers practice a variety of user experience and strategy activities that have been formulated to quickly identify the real problem and the right approach to solving it. By communicating directly with the potential users of your product we can work out a plan to help your business succeed by meeting their unexpressed needs. Our team is also adept with Google Ventures’ Design Sprint process, a method for quickly and accurately answering vital business questions.</p>

<p>On the development side, our team will guide you to the right technology for getting your app into the market quickly, with the ability to scale as your knowledge grows. During the discovery process we’ll formalize the right architecture for your product offering as we learn the true user needs behind it.</p>

<h2>User experience and user interface design</h2>

</div>

<p>Your app needs to be aimed at the right users and solve the problems that are most meaningful to them. It also needs to be easy to use, not just beautiful. We know how to tackle these challenges. Over the course of a project we’ll continually refine our user research, and test prototypes of new functionality to better understand its impact before building. By approaching user experience iteratively we can lower expenses and the risk associated with building the wrong product.</p>

<p>As we further refine the features being built we’ll also develop a scalable design system to accommodate your future updates. We know that your business is going to change over time and the user interface has to be constructed so that you aren’t fighting it whenever the thinking behind it evolves.</p>

<h2>Full-stack JavaScript web development</h2>

</div>

<p>Our developers build flexible, fast and scalable web applications using Node.js, Express and React. Why did we choose to go with JavaScript for our entire tech stack? Simply put, hiring developers with deep client-side JS proficiency allows them to take their existing knowledge to the server-side. The result is a quicker path to expertise based on fluency in one language instead of many.
Using React to render the user interface helps the designers and developers approach the build of an application in a more modular and systematic way. Over time this results in a more scalable and adaptable visual language, and lays the groundwork for a web whose future is tied to custom components.
We can even use these skills to build apps for iOS and Android using the React Native framework. Developers can use the language and tools they’re already proficient in to output code suitable for building rich native app experiences for today’s smartphones.</p>
