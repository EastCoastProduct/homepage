            <blockquote><p>I have worked with multiple developers from East Coast Product on a variety of projects. In each instance, even though they were remote, the ECP developers have made it a point to become a fully integrated part of the team. They communicate effectively, meet deadlines, and most importantly, produce high-quality deliverables. I would recommend working with East Coast Product to any of my colleagues and look forward to my next experience working with them myself.</p></blockquote>

            <blockquote><p>East Coast Productâ€™s Agile approach allowed for close collaboration and for both teams to iterate on the product quickly. They excel at UX and keeping the end user in mind, and were strong communicators at the price of offshore resources. They proved highly adaptable, proactive, and valuable.</p></blockquote>

They executed everything that was asked for in a forward-thinking technical way.</p></blockquote>
